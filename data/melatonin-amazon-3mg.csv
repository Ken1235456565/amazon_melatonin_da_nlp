I struggle to fall asleep because I can't shut off my brain. I've tried so many things to no avail.  I started looking into natural things and came across these and decided to try them. To my surprise they have worked wonders! I take them 15 mins or so before bed and I fall sleep quickly. No more tossing and turning for hrs watching the clock and knowing tomorrow is going to suck. I went from on average getting 5-6 hrs of sleep a night to almost 8 hrs of sleep every night. They taste alright, work fast and I wake up ready to tackle the day.  So if you're struggling to fall asleep or can't find anything that helps try these.  10/10 recommend.","October 27, 2024",5.0,"When nothing else has worked, these did.",Amanda,True

Well, I'm thrilled to report that I've finally found the winning combination: OLLY Sleep Gummies paired with Sleepy Cocoa!Let's start with the Olly Sleep Gummies. These little gems have been a game changer for me. The blend of Melatonin, L-Theanine, and soothing botanicals like Chamomile and Lemon Balm has been incredibly effective in helping me relax and drift off to sleep. I love the fact that they are non-habit forming, and the Blackberry Zen flavor is just delightful – a treat for the taste buds before bed. Taking two gummies 30 minutes before sleep has become a sacred ritual in my nighttime routine.Now, let's talk about Sleepy Cocoa. I stumbled upon this product while searching for a melatonin-free option to complement the gummies. Sleepy Cocoa, with its blend of GABA, magnesium, and cherry tart extract, is the perfect partner. It's not only delicious, but also soothing and comforting. I love curling up with a warm cup of this rich, creamy hot chocolate before bed. The fact that it's melatonin-free means I can enjoy it alongside my Olly gummies without worrying about overdoing it with melatonin.Together, these two products have revolutionized my bedtime routine. I start with the Olly Gummies, then prepare my Sleepy Cocoa as I wind down with a book or some light music. The combination of the gummies' natural sleep aids and the calming supplements of the cocoa creates a relaxing atmosphere that prepares my body and mind for sleep. I've noticed a significant improvement in the time it takes for me to fall asleep, and the quality of my sleep has greatly improved. I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, without any grogginess.The ingredient selection for both products has been outstanding, and I appreciate the attention to detail in their formulation – no artificial colors or flavors, and gluten-free options cater to health-conscious consumers like me.In conclusion, if you're struggling with sleep, I highly recommend giving Olly Sleep Gummies and Sleepy Cocoa a try. This dynamic duo has been the key to unlocking restful, peaceful nights for me.

Are. Amazing.Let me start by explaining, I am a huge insomniac. I’m a night owl so, that alone makes it harder for me to go to sleep cuz I’d rather be up at night, which means I subconsciously fight sleep lol. That, coupled with my anxiety issues and my complete inability to shut off my mind, keeps me awake into the wee hours of the morning.I do have an Rx sleep aid (Seroquel). It’s not a sleeping pill, per se, rather, it is an anxiety med that causes drowsiness. I used to be able to take 1 pill and go to sleep, but I can’t anymore. I have to take anywhere between 3-4 to fall asleep.Until I bought these.I was very skeptical because it takes so much prescription strength medicine to get me to sleep; how could an “all natural” supplement get me to sleep?! But, figured I’d give it a try...what did I have to lose besides $16???So glad I did! I take 2 of these to get me into a sleepy mood. I start getting a little groggy, just a normal sleepy, nothing too heavy or “forceful”. About an hour later I take 1 of my sleeping pills - ONE!!! And a third one of these and I’m asleep within the hour.I sleep restfully (no more tossing and turning) and I feel amazing in the morning. Eventually, I plan to wean myself off the sleeping pills altogether but I’ve only been taking these for a week now so I’ll get there eventually.The taste is slightly bitter but blackberries aren’t the sweetest fruit (IMO) so I wouldn’t expect these to be super sweet either. They don’t taste bad by any means, just not quite as sweet as the other 2 Olly vitamins I take.Trust me when I say, if these can get ME, of all people, to sleep, they can get anyone to sleep","May 1, 2020",5.0,Shocked by the results.,MDH,True

Before taking Olly Sleep I've tried Vicks Zzzquil and it just honestly hasn't been the best results. So I thought I'd give Olly Sleep a shot and the results are freaking amazing!!

The taste is good and they actually help my brain to shut up before falling asleep. I would always go to bed early, but my thoughts will wander, and I would stay awake for hours. With these gummies I can actually calm my brain and body! Take 30 minutes before bed or when (recommend from the instructions) you’re ready to sleep, and voila!","December 28, 2023",5.0,Thank you!,Annette,True

Well, I'm thrilled to report that I've finally found the winning combination: OLLY Sleep Gummies paired with Sleepy Cocoa!Let's start with the Olly Sleep Gummies. These little gems have been a game changer for me. The blend of Melatonin, L-Theanine, and soothing botanicals like Chamomile and Lemon Balm has been incredibly effective in helping me relax and drift off to sleep. I love the fact that they are non-habit forming, and the Blackberry Zen flavor is just delightful – a treat for the taste buds before bed. Taking two gummies 30 minutes before sleep has become a sacred ritual in my nighttime routine.Now, let's talk about Sleepy Cocoa. I stumbled upon this product while searching for a melatonin-free option to complement the gummies. Sleepy Cocoa, with its blend of GABA, magnesium, and cherry tart extract, is the perfect partner. It's not only delicious, but also soothing and comforting. I love curling up with a warm cup of this rich, creamy hot chocolate before bed. The fact that it's melatonin-free means I can enjoy it alongside my Olly gummies without worrying about overdoing it with melatonin.Together, these two products have revolutionized my bedtime routine. I start with the Olly Gummies, then prepare my Sleepy Cocoa as I wind down with a book or some light music. The combination of the gummies' natural sleep aids and the calming supplements of the cocoa creates a relaxing atmosphere that prepares my body and mind for sleep. I've noticed a significant improvement in the time it takes for me to fall asleep, and the quality of my sleep has greatly improved. I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, without any grogginess.The ingredient selection for both products has been outstanding, and I appreciate the attention to detail in their formulation – no artificial colors or flavors, and gluten-free options cater to health-conscious consumers like me.In conclusion, if you're struggling with sleep, I highly recommend giving Olly Sleep Gummies and Sleepy Cocoa a try. This dynamic duo has been the key to unlocking restful, peaceful nights for me.

In the past, I purchased the ""goodbye stress"" gummies of this brand which worked surprisingly well so I decided to give the Melatonin gummies a go. For me, the dosis is much too high so I've been taking half a Gummy which is more than enough in my opinion. Even after taking it several nights in a row I never experienced any adverse effects such as nightmares or a headache which regularly happened to me with some other brands. The only adverse effect that I sometimes feel is that I'm a little groggy. So far, this is the best Melatonin I've come across in the US.I would give it 5 stars if there was a sugar free version with a lower dosis of Melatonin (it's really bad to take it after brushing your teeth/it messes with your blood sugar).","October 15, 2023",4.0,Finally a Melatonin that works and doesn't give me nightmares!,VieVie,True

This stuff works absolutely amazing! This is my first time trying Olly Sleep and the results are amazing! Before taking Olly Sleep I've tried Vicks Zzzquil and it just honestly hasn't been the best results. So I thought I'd give Olly Sleep a shot and the results are freaking amazing!! I only take 1 Gummy which contains 1.5mg of melatonin and within 10 to 15min its got me knocked out and I sleep like a rock! I have a Samsung Watch 4 so it records my sleep and was bought for the reason. And my sleep score has went from 40's to 50's to now in the 80's and 90's! Less movement/awake time during the night, a total of only 23min when usually it's over an hour. My deep sleep could improve as it was 33min, but that's not from the gummies, that's more so from just myself because I got almost 2 hours of REM sleep aka dreaming stage, and I got 4hrs and 8min of light sleep. Will have to try going to sleep sooner and see if I can get more sleep. Lol. I dream every night, always had very vivid dreams! It's amazing and I love it! I hope it never changes! The Olly Sleep doesn't leave me groggy but it does take me a min to get out of bed lol. I haven't slept this hard in a long time! But thank you Olly Sleep, you have really improved my sleep! 10 stars all around if I could give it!! It's a MUST TRY! Also, the taste isn't bad at all.

My experience trying this product was very very scary. Before I purchased it I read all of the reviews the majority were positive and just a few negative experiences. For me my experience was very scary. After 20 minutes of taking the product could have been 15 minutes of taking the product I began to feel real nauseated severely nauseated and extremely dizzy. So I thought I better Google to see what the side effects this product may have and both were listed, may cause dizziness and nausea. I became so sick I thought I was going to actually have to go to ER but I got enough strength to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while and the nausea and the dizziness just intensified. This is all true this is not a makeup story. This is my personal experience of trying this product. Again this is not to downplay the product because everybody body operates and functions differently. After laying down praying God don't let me die take away this feeling and finally I got up and was able to get something salty to try to kind of help the nausea. I drink some water and got something a little salty that helped a little bit. And finally I fell a little bit better and after a couple hours then I felt finally fell asleep. But after getting up this morning I feel a whole lot better than what I did last night but I still feel the residue of the nausea real sensitive stomach and still a little bit of dizziness. So again I'm sharing this to say do your research you know the only way you got to know more or less per se is to try it but if you know that you may be a little sensitive I wouldn't give it a try. I've used other products by OLLY and they have been very beneficial but I never tried the ones as a sleep aid. The product isn't cheap and I spent close to $80 or $70 dollars, but because I feel so much better today, I can care less about getting a refund. That's, just how sick it made me.

I still had my old bottle of the same product and checked everything thinking maybe this was one of amazons sham products but it looks legit sadly. Only difference I noticed was the ingredients list. The old one had beet sugar, like in the description here, and the new package has sugar water instead. Not sure how big of a difference that could make but it’s the only thing that I see different.

I am generally extremely tired and low energy during the day, yet I lay there at night unable to fall asleep and it’s just a horrible cycle that ends with me staying awake mostly for days at a time or getting very little sleep until I eventually crash. And relying on caffeine to get through the day and workouts even though my doctor says my thyroid levels are “balanced”. I’ve tried many other sleep aids and melatonin that has done NOTHING for me, so I was very weary to try this, but I bought a bottle of it just to see as I have many other times.

My experience trying this product was very very scary. Before I purchased it I read all of the reviews the majority were positive and just a few negative experiences. For me my experience was very scary. After 20 minutes of taking the product could have been 15 minutes of taking the product I began to feel real nauseated severely nauseated and extremely dizzy. So I thought I better Google to see what the side effects this product may have and both were listed, may cause dizziness and nausea. I became so sick I thought I was going to actually have to go to ER but I got enough strength to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while and the nausea and the dizziness just intensified. This is all true this is not a makeup story. This is my personal experience of trying this product. Again this is not to downplay the product because everybody body operates and functions differently. After laying down praying God don't let me die take away this feeling and finally I got up and was able to get something salty to try to kind of help the nausea. I drink some water and got something a little salty that helped a little bit. And finally I fell a little bit better and after a couple hours then I felt finally fell asleep. But after getting up this morning I feel a whole lot better than what I did last night but I still feel the residue of the nausea real sensitive stomach and still a little bit of dizziness. So again I'm sharing this to say do your research you know the only way you got to know more or less per se is to try it but if you know that you may be a little sensitive I wouldn't give it a try. I've used other products by OLLY and they have been very beneficial but I never tried the ones as a sleep aid. The product isn't cheap and I spent close to $80 or $70 dollars, but because I feel so much better today, I can care less about getting a refund. That's, just how sick it made me.

My experience trying this product was very very scary. Before I purchased it I read all of the reviews the majority were positive and just a few negative experiences. For me my experience was very scary. After 20 minutes of taking the product could have been 15 minutes of taking the product I began to feel real nauseated severely nauseated and extremely dizzy. So I thought I better Google to see what the side effects this product may have and both were listed, may cause dizziness and nausea. I became so sick I thought I was going to actually have to go to ER but I got enough strength to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while and the nausea and the dizziness just intensified. This is all true this is not a makeup story. This is my personal experience of trying this product. Again this is not to downplay the product because everybody body operates and functions differently. After laying down praying God don't let me die take away this feeling and finally I got up and was able to get something salty to try to kind of help the nausea. I drink some water and got something a little salty that helped a little bit. And finally I fell a little bit better and after a couple hours then I felt finally fell asleep. But after getting up this morning I feel a whole lot better than what I did last night but I still feel the residue of the nausea real sensitive stomach and still a little bit of dizziness. So again I'm sharing this to say do your research you know the only way you got to know more or less per se is to try it but if you know that you may be a little sensitive I wouldn't give it a try. I've used other products by OLLY and they have been very beneficial but I never tried the ones as a sleep aid. The product isn't cheap and I spent close to $80 or $70 dollars, but because I feel so much better today, I can care less about getting a refund. That's, just how sick it made me. Hopefully, it Works for you!","February 18, 2024",1.0,Felt like death,LadyGLadyG,True

Well, I'm thrilled to report that I've finally found the winning combination: OLLY Sleep Gummies paired with Sleepy Cocoa!Let's start with the Olly Sleep Gummies. These little gems have been a game changer for me. The blend of Melatonin, L-Theanine, and soothing botanicals like Chamomile and Lemon Balm has been incredibly effective in helping me relax and drift off to sleep. I love the fact that they are non-habit forming, and the Blackberry Zen flavor is just delightful – a treat for the taste buds before bed. Taking two gummies 30 minutes before sleep has become a sacred ritual in my nighttime routine.Now, let's talk about Sleepy Cocoa. I stumbled upon this product while searching for a melatonin-free option to complement the gummies. Sleepy Cocoa, with its blend of GABA, magnesium, and cherry tart extract, is the perfect partner. It's not only delicious, but also soothing and comforting. I love curling up with a warm cup of this rich, creamy hot chocolate before bed. The fact that it's melatonin-free means I can enjoy it alongside my Olly gummies without worrying about overdoing it with melatonin.Together, these two products have revolutionized my bedtime routine. I start with the Olly Gummies, then prepare my Sleepy Cocoa as I wind down with a book or some light music. The combination of the gummies' natural sleep aids and the calming supplements of the cocoa creates a relaxing atmosphere that prepares my body and mind for sleep. I've noticed a significant improvement in the time it takes for me to fall asleep, and the quality of my sleep has greatly improved. I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, without any grogginess.The ingredient selection for both products has been outstanding, and I appreciate the attention to detail in their formulation – no artificial colors or flavors, and gluten-free options cater to health-conscious consumers like me.In conclusion, if you're struggling with sleep, I highly recommend giving Olly Sleep Gummies and Sleepy Cocoa a try. This dynamic duo has been the key to unlocking restful, peaceful nights for me.

Are. Amazing.Let me start by explaining, I am a huge insomniac. I’m a night owl so, that alone makes it harder for me to go to sleep cuz I’d rather be up at night, which means I subconsciously fight sleep lol. That, coupled with my anxiety issues and my complete inability to shut off my mind, keeps me awake into the wee hours of the morning.I do have an Rx sleep aid (Seroquel). It’s not a sleeping pill, per se, rather, it is an anxiety med that causes drowsiness. I used to be able to take 1 pill and go to sleep, but I can’t anymore. I have to take anywhere between 3-4 to fall asleep.Until I bought these.I was very skeptical because it takes so much prescription strength medicine to get me to sleep; how could an “all natural” supplement get me to sleep?! But, figured I’d give it a try...what did I have to lose besides $16???So glad I did! I take 2 of these to get me into a sleepy mood. I start getting a little groggy, just a normal sleepy, nothing too heavy or “forceful”. About an hour later I take 1 of my sleeping pills - ONE!!! And a third one of these and I’m asleep within the hour.I sleep restfully (no more tossing and turning) and I feel amazing in the morning. Eventually, I plan to wean myself off the sleeping pills altogether but I’ve only been taking these for a week now so I’ll get there eventually.The taste is slightly bitter but blackberries aren’t the sweetest fruit (IMO) so I wouldn’t expect these to be super sweet either. They don’t taste bad by any means, just not quite as sweet as the other 2 Olly vitamins I take.Trust me when I say, if these can get ME, of all people, to sleep, they can get anyone to sleep","May 1, 2020",5.0,Shocked by the results.,MDH,True

This stuff works absolutely amazing! This is my first time trying Olly Sleep and the results are amazing! Before taking Olly Sleep I've tried Vicks Zzzquil and it just honestly hasn't been the best results. So I thought I'd give Olly Sleep a shot and the results are freaking amazing!! I only take 1 Gummy which contains 1.5mg of melatonin and within 10 to 15min its got me knocked out and I sleep like a rock!

Less movement/awake time during the night, a total of only 23min when usually it's over an hour. My deep sleep could improve as it was 33min, but that's not from the gummies, that's more so from just myself because I got almost 2 hours of REM sleep aka dreaming stage, and I got 4hrs and 8min of light sleep. Will have to try going to sleep sooner and see if I can get more sleep. Lol. I dream every night, always had very vivid dreams! It's amazing and I love it! I hope it never changes!

Well, I'm thrilled to report that I've finally found the winning combination: OLLY Sleep Gummies paired with Sleepy Cocoa!Let's start with the Olly Sleep Gummies. These little gems have been a game changer for me. The blend of Melatonin, L-Theanine, and soothing botanicals like Chamomile and Lemon Balm has been incredibly effective in helping me relax and drift off to sleep. I love the fact that they are non-habit forming, and the Blackberry Zen flavor is just delightful – a treat for the taste buds before bed. Taking two gummies 30 minutes before sleep has become a sacred ritual in my nighttime routine.Now, let's talk about Sleepy Cocoa. I stumbled upon this product while searching for a melatonin-free option to complement the gummies. Sleepy Cocoa, with its blend of GABA, magnesium, and cherry tart extract, is the perfect partner. It's not only delicious, but also soothing and comforting. I love curling up with a warm cup of this rich, creamy hot chocolate before bed. The fact that it's melatonin-free means I can enjoy it alongside my Olly gummies without worrying about overdoing it with melatonin.Together, these two products have revolutionized my bedtime routine. I start with the Olly Gummies, then prepare my Sleepy Cocoa as I wind down with a book or some light music. The combination of the gummies' natural sleep aids and the calming supplements of the cocoa creates a relaxing atmosphere that prepares my body and mind for sleep. I've noticed a significant improvement in the time it takes for me to fall asleep, and the quality of my sleep has greatly improved. I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, without any grogginess.The ingredient selection for both products has been outstanding, and I appreciate the attention to detail in their formulation – no artificial colors or flavors, and gluten-free options cater to health-conscious consumers like me.In conclusion, if you're struggling with sleep, I highly recommend giving Olly Sleep Gummies and Sleepy Cocoa a try.

I can't be thankful enough because I can regulate the dose to 1-2 gummy when I am really sleepy and the BEST of all is it doesn't create a habit so you can take it only when you need it + it tastes good. If I had to say a negative remark is maybe the price is a little high for the count but if that is the cost of my peaceful sleep, then so be it.You will not be disappointed.","March 4, 2020",5.0,Miracle gummy,Viktor,True

Also, the OCD side of me is bothered by the fact that it doesn't contain 60 gummies so you'd have a whole month's worth, because chewing 2 a night means only having 25 days worth in a bottle.

I wake up, then it'll be about another hour before I fall asleep again.  I do think this product has extended those cycles. I seem to be maintaining about two hours now, which is great, considering!

Is it possible to build a tolerance to these gummies within 2 months? Not sure. I fall asleep quickly but I no longer stay asleep all night. I wake up around 3am or 4am - wide awake and again my thoughts start running and it's hard to fall back asleep. Unfortunately, I don't think these work for long term or at least, don't work for everyday use so I won't be repurchasing. Not worth the extra calories!Original Review:I'm not a true insomniac, I just have a really hard time falling asleep quickly and staying asleep. It sometimes takes me an hour or two of tossing and turning before I finally fall asleep usually because I'm dwelling on something that I just can't stop thinking about despite listening to relaxing podcasts, doing yoga, etc. Then, in the middle of the night, my eyes will pop open for no reason and my thoughts start running again.I have taken other melatonin brands with mixed success. They tend to work but I usually feel groggy and gross in the morning.I've taken these gummies for 4 evenings straight and feel like they're working for me. I follow the instructions and have implemented a strict bedtime routine to try and reap the most benefits. I have a strict no-screen policy starting around 8:30pm take the gummies around 9pm. After brushing my teeth and my skincare routine, I'll hop into bed to do some reading until I start feeling sleepy. I find it takes about 30 minutes of reading before I start to feel the effects. Once I put the book away, I don't seem to be struggling to fall asleep and I'm also not jarred awake by my own thoughts in the middle of the night, which is such a relief!I actually really enjoy the taste and the gummies are just so much more enjoyable than chalky pills. It's hard to say if these are truly medically effective and not just a placebo effect - I hear so much about the fraudulent claims of vitamin companies. But, given the great results so far, why mess with a good thing? I just hope I won't always have to rely on these and the habits of my body will eventually take over for a good night's rest.","November 11, 2020",3.0,"Started strong, not so much now",Dazzle Driller,True

It was quite a miserable experience. I now take 1/2 of a gummy which still leads to some grogginess but allows me function the next day.

My first experience with this product was with a 100 count bottle purchased locally.  I very much like the product and it works well for me - good taste and I fall asleep quicker.  So, looking to save a little on price, I came to Amazon where I misread the quantity and ordered two 50 count bottles rather than the two 100 ct bottles I thought I was getting.  They were shipped as promised and were well packaged with gel cooling packs in a foam padded box (made me wonder where they came from).  I just opened the first new bottle last night and noticed a sticky film on the bottom of the bottle where the gummies had been sitting.  Note, in the time I've used the 100 count, this has never appeared.  So, I checked for an expiration date and lot code.  There is none on this bottle, but the unopened bottle has both as does the 100 count bottle.  I also noted that the unopened 50 count which has the lot code and exp. date also has the film at the bottom of the bottle.  Based on all of this, I am unlikely to order this product online in the future - I can get it locally at less expense and I can see before I buy that it is properly marked, as well as experience tells me the product will be fresher.","July 17, 2017",3.0,I very much like the product and it works well for me - ...,VSankar,True

However I’m not sure if it’s the other ingredients and herbs in this mixture but I had a really strange reaction to it. I had a couple bad nights sleep in a row and was feeling rather exhausted. I took two gummy‘s at 9 PM. Within about a half an hour I felt like I was drunk and was saying odd things to my daughter who kept asking me what was wrong with me. I was super drowsy and eventually by 10 o’clock fell asleep. It wasn’t a restful deep sleep though, it was more like a drugged, psychotic, in an out, restless sleep. I woke up at 4 AM with my mouth as dry as the desert and chugged water.  At 5 AM my dog needed to go out and just getting up out of bed and walking her outside I felt like I was in another dimension. Totally out of it. Then I fell back asleep into the most scariest, relaxed state I’ve ever felt. I felt like I couldn’t move my body, my breathing was very shallow and slow and my heart rate was slow. I almost had to remind myself to breathe. Ever since I got up at 6:45 I have felt groggy all morning. Again, I’ve never had this reaction with just straight melatonin, so it must be the other ingredients in this mix that didn’t agree with me.

My experience trying this product was very very scary. Before I purchased it I read all of the reviews the majority were positive and just a few negative experiences. For me my experience was very scary. After 20 minutes of taking the product could have been 15 minutes of taking the product I began to feel real nauseated severely nauseated and extremely dizzy. So I thought I better Google to see what the side effects this product may have and both were listed, may cause dizziness and nausea. I became so sick I thought I was going to actually have to go to ER but I got enough strength to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while and the nausea and the dizziness just intensified. This is all true this is not a makeup story. This is my personal experience of trying this product. Again this is not to downplay the product because everybody body operates and functions differently. After laying down praying God don't let me die take away this feeling and finally I got up and was able to get something salty to try to kind of help the nausea. I drink some water and got something a little salty that helped a little bit. And finally I fell a little bit better and after a couple hours then I felt finally fell asleep. But after getting up this morning I feel a whole lot better than what I did last night but I still feel the residue of the nausea real sensitive stomach and still a little bit of dizziness. So again I'm sharing this to say do your research you know the only way you got to know more or less per se is to try it but if you know that you may be a little sensitive I wouldn't give it a try. I've used other products by OLLY and they have been very beneficial but I never tried the ones as a sleep aid. The product isn't cheap and I spent close to $80 or $70 dollars, but because I feel so much better today, I can care less about getting a refund. That's, just how sick it made me.

Because melatonin is sold over the counter as a dietary supplement, I expected this product to be fairly innocuous. Boy was I wrong. Within 10-15 minutes of taking just one 3mg gummy, I felt as if I had been drugged and was losing muscle control. The effects were unexpectedly potent and uncomfortable. I noticed my breathing had become more shallow and I had to consciously remind myself to take deeper breaths. The unexpected effects sent me into a mild panic and I was afraid of what would happen if I fell asleep. I felt drowsy but purposely kept myself awake for a couple hours until I started to feel the effects of the melatonin begin to lessen.I slept well through the night, but felt groggy, heavy and oddly depressed most of the next day. When I woke up, I was alarmed to see that there were 2 notifications on my smart watch from the middle of the night alerting me that my heart rate had twice dropped below 45 bpm for over 10 minutes while I slept. This is extremely concerning because my resting heart rate is usually in the 60’s and I have no history of cardiac issues.I would strongly advise everyone to use this product with caution and treat it as you would a prescription medication. In fact, some countries like the UK actually require a prescription for melatonin. Consulting with your physician prior to taking any sleep aid would be prudent, even if it is sold OTC, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or take any other medications. All drugs affect everyone differently and you don't want to be caught off guard with some of the potential effects.","January 2, 2022",1.0,USE WITH CAUTION,Lee P,True

My experience trying this product was very very scary. Before I purchased it I read all of the reviews the majority were positive and just a few negative experiences. For me my experience was very scary. After 20 minutes of taking the product could have been 15 minutes of taking the product I began to feel real nauseated severely nauseated and extremely dizzy. So I thought I better Google to see what the side effects this product may have and both were listed, may cause dizziness and nausea. I became so sick I thought I was going to actually have to go to ER but I got enough strength to go to my bedroom and lay down for a while and the nausea and the dizziness just intensified. This is all true this is not a makeup story. This is my personal experience of trying this product. Again this is not to downplay the product because everybody body operates and functions differently. After laying down praying God don't let me die take away this feeling and finally I got up and was able to get something salty to try to kind of help the nausea. I drink some water and got something a little salty that helped a little bit. And finally I fell a little bit better and after a couple hours then I felt finally fell asleep. But after getting up this morning I feel a whole lot better than what I did last night but I still feel the residue of the nausea real sensitive stomach and still a little bit of dizziness. So again I'm sharing this to say do your research you know the only way you got to know more or less per se is to try it but if you know that you may be a little sensitive I wouldn't give it a try. I've used other products by OLLY and they have been very beneficial but I never tried the ones as a sleep aid. The product isn't cheap and I spent close to $80 or $70 dollars, but because I feel so much better today, I can care less about getting a refund. That's, just how sick it made me.
